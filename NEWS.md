# predictmeans (development version)

## Kmatrix() and semipred()

* `Kmatrix()` now builds predicted means from a reference grid evaluated with
  the model's own basis information. It handles covariates that:
  * enter through transformations: `poly()`, `ns()`, `bs()`, `log()`,
    `scale()`, `I()`;
  * appear only inside interactions (`A:x` without `x`, `x:z`);
  * are mgcv smooth terms (`s()`, `te()`, `s(x, by = A)`).
  These cases previously stopped with "subscript out of bounds" or
  "object not found".
* `Kmatrix()` and `predictmeans()` now support `mgcv::gam()`/`bam()` models,
  using the lpmatrix of the smooths. Random-effect smooths (`bs = "re"`,
  `bs = "fs"`) are excluded by default (`exclude` argument).
* New `Kmatrix()` argument `cov_reduce`: fix covariates with any summary
  function (default `mean`, e.g. `median`), or use `"average"` to average the
  predictions over the observed covariate values.
* `Kmatrix()` now also handles:
  * character and logical predictors;
  * `factor(x)` terms in the formula (`modelterm` may be `"x"` or
    `"factor(x)"`);
  * models fitted without a `data` argument;
  * a transformed response together with `data =`.
* `Kmatrix()` returns the reference grid (`refgrid`) and flags non-estimable
  rows in `attr(K, "estimable")`.
* A matrix `covariateV` for several covariates is now used as a set of joint
  prediction points, as documented; previously it was ignored.
* `semipred()` uses `Kmatrix()` on the `semireg` object directly, without
  refitting an auxiliary `lm()`. The smooth basis is averaged over the same
  reference grid as the fixed part. As a result, factors not in `modelterm`,
  including `by` factors of the smooths, are averaged correctly instead of
  causing an error.
* The covariate summary printed by `prtnum = TRUE` now goes through
  `message()`, so it can be suppressed.
* Kmatrix() is faster on large data (about 4-15x on a 20,000-row, 360-cell
  model).
* New tests check that results for every case supported by 1.1.1 are
  unchanged, and compare the new cases with emmeans and mgcv.

## Fewer dependencies

* `plyr` is no longer used.
* `HRW`, `lmeInfo`, `lmeSplines`, `plotly` and `splines2` moved from Imports
  to Suggests. They are only needed for, respectively:
  * HRW: example data;
  * lmeInfo: `varcomp()` on `lme` models;
  * lmeSplines: `smZ(type = "smspline")`;
  * plotly: `semipred(threeD = TRUE)`;
  * splines2: the splines2 spline types in `smZ()`.
  A clear message asks for the package when such a feature is used.
  Installing predictmeans now pulls in 76 packages instead of 112. This also
  avoids current HRW's requirement of R >= 4.5.
* `HRW::pointsInPoly()` is replaced by an internal copy. It also closes open
  polygons correctly; HRW's version adds a spurious vertex when the last
  vertex does not repeat the first.
